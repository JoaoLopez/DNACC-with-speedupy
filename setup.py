"""DNACC: Calculation of DNA-coated colloid interactions

DNACC is a Python module to calculate the interaction details for a set of
DNA-coated colloids.  These include the free energy of binding and of
entropic repulsion and the probability of any two tethers (or groups of
tethers) to form a bond.

Currently supported tether and colloid configurations include: short dsDNA
tethers (treated as rigid rods) grafted on parallel plates (in explicit and
in mean-field representation), as well as on spheres.  An approximate
sphere-sphere potential can be obtained using the Derjaguin approximation.

The module is extensible, so it should be relatively straigthforward to add
other kinds of tethers grafted on colloids with different geometries.

If you use this module, you *must* cite the following paper::

  Varilly, Angioletti-Uberti, Mognetti and Frenkel, "A general theory
  of DNA-mediated and other valence-limited interactions", submitted (2012)
