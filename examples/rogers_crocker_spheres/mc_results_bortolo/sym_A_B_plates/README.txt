The folders LCE_wrong, Run_500_500_n15 and Run_500_500_n16 and the file
tethers.dat were generated by Bortolo M. Mognetti using a Fortran code to
(a) calculate Delta G^cnf_ij for ssDNA (as described in the appendix of the
paper) and (b) calculate the number of bonds formed at different plate
separations and binding energies, as well as the resulting interaction
potentials, using Monte Carlo sampling, a la Leunissen and Frenkel, JCP,
2011.

Here, we use this data in the DNACC code to compare Monte Carlo results
to those generated by the self-consistent theory, both the explicit
tethers version as well as the mean-field version.
